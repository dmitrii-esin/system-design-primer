# Feynman Technique Practice Prompts

## How to Use This

The Feynman Technique: Explain a concept as if teaching a 12-year-old. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

**Steps:**
1. Pick a concept below
2. Explain it OUT LOUD (or write) without notes
3. Use simple words, no jargon
4. Use an analogy if helpful
5. Identify where you struggled
6. Go back to notes, fill gaps, try again
